1. Introduction to the TSP Problem.
Begin by defining the traveling salesman problem (TSP):
The TSP is a fundamental optimization dilemma in which the goal is to identify the most cost-effective way to visit a series of cities, each exactly once, before returning to the starting point.
The expense of traveling between cities is represented by distances that are symmetric.

2. Complexity and Relevance
Explain why the TSP is significant:
TSP is NP-hard, which means that finding the best solution becomes more difficult as the number of cities increases.
Because of its practical uses, it is valuable in industries such as logistics, circuit design, and route planning.

3. Simulated Annealing (SA) Overview
Describe the simulated annealing method:
SA is a stochastic strategy used to approach a function's global optimum. It was modeled after the annealing process in metallurgy, in which materials are heated and cooled to remove flaws.
The algorithm begins with a random solution and iteratively improves it by exploring associated with solutions (swaps between two cities) while accepting less perfect choices at a decreasing probability (controlled by a temperature parameter).

4. Technical Details and C++ Features
Describe your use of C++:
STL (Standard Template Library): Used to create data structures such as std::vector.
Algorithms: To randomly allocate the initial crash, we used std::shuffle.
File I/O: I used ifstream to read city data from a file.
Mathematical Functions: <cmath> is used to figure out distances according to Euclidean geometry.

5. Everything was done in my project but in the end 
When I was finding the output in the terminal of VSCode, the terminal (bottom) bar was showing again & again it was showing segmentation fault and then i was took the help of stack overflow in the project to solve the problem .
